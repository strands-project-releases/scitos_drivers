Using the robot
---------------

Various aspects of the robot are exposed as ROS services, published topics, subscribed topics and dynamic_reconfigure parameters. These are divided into 5 "modules":
* Drive - for the control of the motors.
* EBC - for controlling the power for extra devices (pan tilt and cameras).
* Head - for controlling the HRI head.
* Display - for the small status display on the base.
* Charger - for battery monitoring and charging control.

### Drive
#### Published topics
* `/odom (nav_msgs::Odometry)`
The odometric position of the robot (Odometry.pose), and it's linear/angular velocity (Odometry.twist.linear.x, Odometry.twist.angular.z). This is also published as a TF between `/odom` and `/base_footprint_link`.
* `/bumper (std_msgs::Bool)`
State of the robots bumper, published regularly not only when the state changes.
* `/mileage (std_msgs::Float32)`
The distance in metres that the robot has travelled since the beginning of time.
* `/charger_status (scitos_msgs::ChargerStatus)`
Detailed information about the current status of the charging circuit.
* `/motor_status (scitos_msgs::MotorStatus)`
The state of the motors, free-run mode, emergency button status, bumer status.

#### Subscribed topics
*  `/cmd_vel (geometry_msgs::Twist)`
Any velocity published on this topic will be sent to the robot motor controller. Twist.linear.x corresponds to the desired linear velocity; Twist.angular.z corresponds to the angular velocity.


#### Services
* `/reset_motorstop (scitos_msgs::ResetMotorStop)` 
This service is an empty request and empty response. It turns off the motor stop, which is engaged when the robot bumps into something. It can only be turned off if the robot is not longer in collision.
* `/reset_odometry (scitos_msgs::ResetOdometry)`
This empty request/response service sets the robot odometry to zero.
* `/emergency_stop (scitos_msgs::EmergencyStop)`
This empty request/response service stops the robot. It is equivalent to the bumper being pressed - the motor stop is engaged, and can be reset with /reset_motorstop.
* `/enable_motors (scitos_msgs::EnableMotors)` 
This service takes a `std_msgs::Bool enabled` in the request, and gives an empty response. Disabling the motors is the same as placing the robot into "Free Run" mode from the status display.


### Head
#### Published topics
* `/head/actual_state (sensor_msgs::JointState)`
The actual joint states of the head. This topic is published at 30Hz, although I'm not sure what the actual frequency the hardware provides is.

#### Subscribed topics
* `/head/commanded_state (sensor_msgs::JointState)`
To control the robot's head position. There are 6 axis that can be controlled by placing the joint name in JointState.name and the desired state in JointState.position. The axis are:
  * `HeadPan` - the pan joint of the head; 0 to 360 degrees, with a block point at 90 degrees.
  * `HeadTilt` - the tilt of the head; 
  * `EyePan` - the pan of the eyes, without moving the head.
  * `EyeTilt` - the tilt of the eyes, without moving the head.
  * `EyeLidLeft` - the state of the left eye lid, 0..100, 100  fully closed.
  * `EyeLidRight` - the state of the right eye lid, 0..100, 100  fully closed.


### EBC
#### Reconfigure parameters
* `Port0_5V_Enabled (bool)`
Is 5V enabled at port 0
* `Port0_5V_MaxCurrent (float)`
Max current for port 0 5V
* `Port0_12V_Enabled (bool)`
Is 12V enabled at port 0
* `Port0_12V_MaxCurrent (float)`
Max current for port 0 12V
* `Port0_24V_Enabled (bool)`
Is 24V enabled at port 0
* `Port0_24V_MaxCurrent (float)`
Max current for port 0 24V
* `Port1_5V_Enabled (bool)`
Is 5V enabled at port 1
* `Port1_5V_MaxCurrent (float)`
Max current for port 1 5V
* `Port1_12V_Enabled (bool)`
Is 12V enabled at port 1
* `Port1_12V_MaxCurrent (float)`
Max current for port 1 12V
* `Port1_24V_Enabled (bool)`
Is 24V enabled at port 1
* `Port1_24V_MaxCurrent (float)`
Max current for port 1 24V

### Charger
#### Published topics
* `/battery_state (scitos_msgs::BatteryState`
* `/charger_status (scitos_msgs::ChargerStatus`

#### Reconfigure parameters
There are some parameters, but they currently not implemented for fear of messing up...

### Display
#### Published topics
* `/user_menu_selected (std_msgs::Int8)`
This topic is published when one of the user sub-menus  (as set using the dynamic reconfigure parameters) is selected. The value 0..3 indicates which menu item was "clicked".

#### Reconfigure parameters
* `EnableUserMenu (string)`
Is the user menu entry in the status display enabled
* `UserMenuName (string)`
The name of the user menu entry in the main menu of the status display
* `UserMenuEntryName1 (string)`
The name of the first sub menu entry in the user menu of the status display
* `UserMenuEntryName2 (string)`
The name of the second sub menu entry in the user menu of the status display
* `UserMenuEntryName3 (string)`
The name of the third sub menu entry in the user menu of the status display
