  * new SCITOS version
  * Adding machine tags to mira, sick and ptu launch files
  * made the SCITOSDriver config file an argument to use udev rules at UOL. Shouldn't effect anyone else

  * Adding exception catching for mira parameter access. Issue #23 <https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_drivers/issues/23>
  * Closing issue #41 <https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_drivers/issues/41>. Changed the odometry interval to 20ms. This means that the odometry is sent every 20ms. This is the fastest rate I could achieve. Any faster and the odometry was not published any more. The resulting rate is ~47hz. We tested this odometry rate for quite some time and it does not seem to have any negative effects.
  * Update README.md
  * Adding conversion of MIRA debug output to ROS debug messages.
  * Adding msgs dependency
  * Adding bumper to motorstatus topic
  * adding abilty to control eyelids in sync
  * Update CMakeLists.txt
    including scitos_msgs generation before scitos_mira
  * Adding motor status information publication
  * Fixing boost::bind usage for MIRA callbacks
  * Head lights controllable
  * adding headlight callback
  * Chaning head state publication frequency to 5hz to save CPU
  * Tidy up
  * Making SCITOS modules selectable from launch file.
  * add launch file
  * rename..
  * rename scitos_driver=>scitos_mira
  * rename scitos_driver to scitos_mira
  * rename metapackage to scitos_drivers
  * Made into catkin metapackage
