  * Adding exception catching for mira parameter access. Issue #23 <https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_drivers/issues/23>
  * Closing issue #41 <https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_drivers/issues/41>. Changed the odometry interval to 20ms. This means that the odometry is sent every 20ms. This is the fastest rate I could achieve. Any faster and the odometry was not published any more. The resulting rate is ~47hz. We tested this odometry rate for quite some time and it does not seem to have any negative effects.
